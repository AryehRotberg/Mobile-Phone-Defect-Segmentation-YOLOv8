# Mobile-Phone-Defect-Segmentation-YOLOv8

This repository contains mobile phone defect segmentation app / api. The project utilizes the powerful Ultralytics YOLOv8 model to detect and segment scratches on mobile phone screens from images. It's designed to assist in the quality assurance process of mobile phone manufacturing, providing a quick and accurate assessment of screen conditions.

## Technologies Used
- **Ultralytics YOLOv8**: For real-time object detection and segmentation.
- **FastAPI**: For building a high-performance API with automatic interactive documentation.
- **Docker**: For creating, deploying, and running applications by using containers.
- **AWS ECR (Elastic Container Registry)**: For securely storing and managing our Docker container images.
- **AWS EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)**: For scalable computing capacity in the Amazon Web Services cloud.

## Features

- **Scratch Detection**: Precisely identifies the location and quantity of scratches on mobile phone screens.
- **Image Analysis**: Performs real-time image segmentation to analyze screen defects.
- **Scalability**: Deployed on AWS EC2, allowing for high availability and scalability.
